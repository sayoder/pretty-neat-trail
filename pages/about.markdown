The [Pacific Northwest Trail](https://www.pnt.org){:target="_blank_"} is a 1200-mile National Scenic Trail
that runs east-to-west from Glacier National Park to Olympic National Park along
the Canadian border.

I started working on this project in early 2020 as a way to process my
experience on the PNT and write it down for my future self.  I think most of it
is probably boring to read, but at least the pictures are pretty and I hope it
can inspire some future hikers.

If you have any questions or comments, you can email them to me at
[seth.a.yoder@gmail.com](mailto:seth.a.yoder@gmail.com).

I made this site using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com){:target="_blank_"}. I have barely touched the
frontend because I'm mostly trying to get this stuff out of my head before I
forget it, but maybe someday it'll look nice. You can find the code at
[https://github.com/sayoder/pretty-neat-trail](https://github.com/sayoder/pretty-neat-trail){:target="_blank_"}.
