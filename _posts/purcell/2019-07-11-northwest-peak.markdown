I woke up earlier than usual, excited by the big day ahead and the prospect of
sleeping in the NW Peak firetower. I snarfed down breakfast and set off a few
minutes ahead of Bugs and Moose, but I disappeared into the woods to poop and
ended up behind them. We walked together for a little while on the long, gradual
2000-foot forest road climb, sharing with each other about our backgrounds and
off-trail lives. They told me about how they met each other, and the small
renovation contracting business that they started in Olympia.

I was the only one planning on taking the alternate route that day, and I had a
longer day ahead of me than my four friends, so after some time I said my
goodbyes and pushed ahead up the road.

The PNT turned off onto a really beautiful little stretch of trail for a couple
miles before continuing on forest roads.

I ate lunch while being swarmed by mosquitos right next to a marsh on the side
of a forest road (200P). The majority of the rest of my day would be a long
roadwalk. I split off onto the alternate route (204P) and filled up a full 4
liters of water (W206A), because I would be up on a ridge with no water sources
until I rejoined the primary route the following day.

As I was walking up the logging road, a car pulled up beside me -- the first
vehicle I'd seen all day besides a logging crew. The driver rolled down his
window, looked at me for a second, and said, "...You <i>must</i> be lost." I
couldn't help but laugh... I couldn't find the words to tell him that I have
never been more precisely where I intended to be. He told me that he had been
hunting for morels in a recently-burned section of forest up the road, and that
burned sections of forest were the best places to find morels. He showed me his
haul, gave me a couple mushrooms to take with me, and advised me to look on the
edge of the burn areas where the trees are red.

(I found out later that he ran into Cookie Monster and Morning Star further down
the road and told them that he had just met their son.)

Once I made it to the burn area, I put down my pack and started hunting for
morels. I took the stranger's advice and looked for red trees. Between the green
trees and the charred black tree trunks, the trees were indeed red where the
pine needles had been singed but hadn't fallen off. I searched in this liminal
space for a couple of minutes until I found my first cluster of morels, just
humbly poking up from the ashy ground. The second came only a few seconds later.
In about 15 minutes, I had gathered more morels than I could reasonably fit in
my pack without mushing them! This was just the morale boost I needed -- I had
about 2000 more feet to climb, and the 8 extra pounds of water on my back was
already wearing on me.

My only company on the peak were a hoary marmot and two excitable pikas. I wish
I had gotten a picture of them. The fire tower stood alone on the bare rocky
peak. It was windy outside and hard to find a flat rock to cook on. I sliced up
the morels with my pocketknife and tried to wash them with what little water I
had to spare. After about 15 minutes, I had a feast of morel stew and instant
mashed potatoes ready to eat. The morel stew was a little gritty, but still
tasted savory and delicious.
