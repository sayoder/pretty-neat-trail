The morning light washed away my terror from the night before, and I gathered up
the courage to check the pit toilet for dead bodies. There were none.  Relieved,
I packed up and started down the mountain, hiking to the sunny, relaxing tones
of Helado Negro's 2018 album *This Is How You Smile*.

The trailhead on the other side of Mount Zion (1032P) had a proper pit toilet
and full parking lot. I met two older women there who chatted me up for a while
and bestowed upon me a hard-boiled egg, a banana, and a granola bar, gifts which
I cherished and downed immediately after I said goodbye to them.

The trails I followed for the next 9 miles were frankly bizarre. Mostly they
were overgrown old jeep trails, or maybe tiny logging roads. I lost my way
plenty of times, checked my compass constantly, and wondered when I would get
to the beautiful Olympic forests that I expected.
