I packed up my tent just as stealthily as I had set it up, opting for a mobile
trail mix breakfast rather than my traditional oat-based fare. I managed to
weave my way out of the Anacortes Community Forest and back onto a paved road.

Not too far down the road was a general store, "Lake Erie Grocery". I stopped in
for a cup of coffee and chatted up the owner for a little bit.  Hopefully this
would generate enough goodwill that I could sit on the pile of planks outside of
his store for a few minutes. The owner told me that the store was almost 100
years old, and that his family had been running it since the 70s.  I sat outside
on the aforementioned pile of planks and enjoyed my coffee for a few minutes
before forcing myself to continue down the road. A little network of trails
brought me through the woods into Deception Pass State Park.

I didn't have much information about Deception Pass going in, but apparently it
is known for its difficult currents. Water flows through the pass in opposite
directions depending on the tide, and underwater rock formations make strange
eddies that are dangerous for boats. For me, the main experience consisted of
crossing a large bridge with zooming cars and trying to snap a picture without
dropping my camera over the side.

A nice little pair of trails brought me out of the park on the other side. I sat
outside the state park office
